Each post will have:
  postTitle = a title for each post - preferably stated as a question
  postSubtitle = some basic information about each post - date of original post, tags related to the concepts - postSubtitle
  postText = text of post - a paragraph which builds interest in the topic by offering something interesting along the way
  postSource = where the underlying data comes from - list the entity responsible for the data and the date and a link to the source
  a graphic holder - appears after user input, sets size of graphic and offers a reset button to hide the hide the hide the viz
  the data visualization
  graphic - fits inside the graphic holder, is both interesting and useful

Skills needed:
  experience with web visualization frameworks plotly.js d3.js or linking other frameworks with a website
  some sort of database and to store and deliver posts
  experience and tools downloading or referencing large data sets

By end of class, I would like posts that use:
  various sizes and types of data (small, inside code, user input, large, google doc, api)
  various types of graphs (bar, time series, heatmap, graphs that move)
  all three types of analytics (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive)

Potential Questions:
  how tall are you
  when do you go to sleep
  how often do you attend church
  how far do you live from work
  what is your opinion about debt
  how many different cities have you lived in
  how many servings of veggies do you usually eat per day
  how long will I live
  how many facebook friends do you have
  do you have any spiritual belief
  what is your favorite holiday

Issues to address:
  what about links that no longer work
  how do I show that the most recent post shows first
  how can I offer readers a chance to upvote or potentially even comment
    This seems like a feature that adds uneccessary complexity and risk
    If comment, how do I make sure that comments are not abusive or open the site to malicious behavior
